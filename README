    Create an Instance of FTCoreTextView
    Set the styles and the text for the view

Styles Markup:

 _default: It is the default applied to the whole text. You get a default style if you don't use this tag.
 _page: Divide the text in pages. Respond to markup <_page/>
 _bullet: define styles for bullets. Respond to Markups <_bullet>content</bullet>
 _image: define style for images. Respond to markup <_image>imageNameOnBundle.extension</_image>

Notes:

FTCoreText view is constantly developed by FuerteInt.com. Please drop us an email at open-source@fuerteint.com to let us know you are using this component.
Use of the CoreText framework is granted only for iOS 3.2 and later version.

Although FTCoreTextView uses an html-like tag syntax all the complex properties of html are not supported. Most of the time this will result as not formatted text but sometimes it can lead to crashes. Custom drawing path and HTML-like nested tags are now implemented.
